This is an open source extension for [alis.io](http://alis.io/)<br/>

**Languages : Jquery, CSS**

This is a simple script to modify the page style of alis.io to the old version.<br/>
I had posted this in the forum [alisio.ml](http://aforum.tk/), but Greed decided removed it.<br/>
all styles were subtracted from **[TEAMHI](http://teamhi.net/)**
